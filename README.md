# Code Future – Subjects Navigation Page

## Overview

This project was created as part of **Code Future**, a nonprofit initiative dedicated to expanding access to beginner-friendly coding education. My contribution focused on both **frontend development** for the subjects navigation page and the creation of **lesson materials** for Java workshops.

The project is designed to help students explore programming concepts interactively, with a structured UI for navigation and clear, annotated Java examples.

## Features

### Subjects Navigation Page

* Built with **Vue.js** and **HTML/CSS**.
* Provides a simple, intuitive **navigation UI** for students to browse subjects.
* Supports future expansion for additional lessons and resources.

### Java Workshop Materials

Included in this repository are **lesson-oriented Java programs** for teaching **arrays** and **ArrayLists** to beginners:

1. **Arrays.java**

   * Heavily annotated with teaching notes, explanations, and suggested student interactions.
   * Covers:

     * Creating and indexing arrays
     * Assigning and updating array values
     * Array operations (sum, length)
     * Strings in arrays
     * Transition to ArrayLists
     * Common ArrayList methods (`add`, `get`, `set`, `remove`, `clear`)
   * Designed to be used in a classroom/interactive teaching setting.

2. **OutlineClass.java**

   * A simplified reference implementation without detailed commentary.
   * Provides runnable code to demonstrate arrays and ArrayLists in practice.
   * Ideal for walkthroughs or as a student reference after the workshop.

## Technologies Used

* **Vue.js** — frontend framework for the subjects navigation UI
* **HTML/CSS** — styling and layout
* **Java** — workshop lessons and examples

## Educational Impact

* Expanded access to beginner-friendly coding content for students new to programming.
* Introduced fundamental Java concepts in a structured, interactive format.
* Combined annotated code with a working outline to support both instruction and practice.
